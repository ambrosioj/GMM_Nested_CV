# Two phase flow pattern classification based on void fraction time series and machine learning



Codes and features used in the nested cross-validation process proposed in the article "Two phase flow pattern classification based on void fraction time series and machine learning" submitted to the journal flow measurement and instrumentation.

## Repository Structure:

### Data: 
Folder containing the pre-processed features and results obtained.

### Notebooks: 
Folder containing the jupyter notebook used in data analysis.

### Scripts: 
Folder containing python scripts for data processing
  - **"GMM Nested Cross Validation.py"** used for development and validation of nested cross validation process.
  - **"GMM Nested Cross Validation-feature selection.py"** Basically an update of the previous script considering the feature selection process and some little updates. This was the script used to obtain the results discussed in the paper.
